procedure oriented programming.
emphasis is on doing things.
large prgograms are divided into smaller programs known as functions. 
most of functions share global data 
data move openly around teh system from function to function
function transform data from one form to another 
employs top down approach in program design 

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAM 
Object oriented pressure as an approach that provides a way of modularising program 
by creating partitioned memory area for both data and functions that can be used 
as templates for creating copies of such module on demand.
